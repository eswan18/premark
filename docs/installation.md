# Installation

```{note}
Installing Premark using pipx is recommended.
This will make the `premark` executable available in all your Python environments, and the package's dependencies will be installed in an isolated environment, meaning they won't affect other work you do in Python.
```

## Installation via pipx

First, install pipx using [these instructions](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/).

Then, install Premark using it:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/eswan18/premark
```

## Installation Without pipx
    
If you prefer install Premark in a single Python environment, you can just use pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/eswan18/premark
```
